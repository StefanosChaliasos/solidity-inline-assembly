Download the Dataset
====================

__NOTE:__ The total size of the downloaded files after extracting them is
XXXG.

__NOTE:__ This dataset is not required to verify the artifact for the OOPSLA
paper. The dataset is provided to help researchers do more empirical studies
in Solidity Smart contracts beyond analyzing inline assembly usage.

This file contains the instructions for downloading the dataset composed
for analyzing the usage of inline assembly in Solidity smart contracts 
deployed in the Ethereum mainet.
You can find the dataset in this link

To download the tarball that contains the dataset, run the following commands.

```bash
# With an average internet connection that could take up to XXX minutes.
```

These commands will download `XXX` and then
extract it to the `dataset` directory. This directory contains the following
files and directories.
